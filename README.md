# Desktop v2

I'm prototyping some of the designs for an HTML5 / Vue.js-based UI alternative to the JavaFX app. 

First, I want to use as few third-party bits as possible for layout. No need for Bootstrap for the layouts. 

Second, I want to use as few third-party bits as possible for CSS in general. I'm not sure if my CSS-fu is strong enough to get me through a modern, responsive form without Bootstrap, however.

Third, I want to support a more dynamic UI that lets me edit / update all the existing podcasts, and to see what was published and when. So this won't just be the Podcast inception as was done in the JavaFX `desktop` project.

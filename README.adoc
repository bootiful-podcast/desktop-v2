# Desktop v2

I'm prototyping some of the designs for an HTML5 / Vue.js-based UI alternative to the JavaFX app. 

First, I want to use as few third-party bits as possible for layout. No need for Bootstrap for the layouts. 

Second, I want to use as few third-party bits as possible for CSS in general. I'm not sure if my CSS-fu is strong enough to get me through a modern, responsive form without Bootstrap, however.

Third, I want to support a more dynamic UI that lets me edit / update all the existing podcasts, and to see what was published and when. So this won't just be the Podcast inception as was done in the JavaFX `desktop` project.  

Fourth, it'd be nice to use Vue.js for this. I found that it provides a nice experience for building data-driven, form-driven user interfaces. But, then again, I haven't done anything particularly complicated with it so who knows? 

Fifth, I've got a mock-api that i'm using to mock out the actual podcast publication API. I might check that into this repository for a while as well. The goal is to prototype out a few scenarios: 

* uploading a new podcast with the complete data required. 
* uploading a new file 

Sixth, will I need a custom domain or could I deploy this as an Electron.js application? It'd be easier, basically, to use https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/first-app#trying-this-example[Electron.js]. 

Once the mock design is working, it'll be time to integrate it with the API.

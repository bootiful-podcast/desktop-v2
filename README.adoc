= Desktop v2


== The Big Picture
I'm prototyping some of the designs for an HTML5 / Vue.js-based UI alternative to the JavaFX app.

First, I want to use as few third-party bits as possible for layout. No need for Bootstrap for the layouts.

Second, I want to use as few third-party bits as possible for CSS in general. I'm not sure if my CSS-fu is strong enough to get me through a modern, responsive form without Bootstrap, however.

Third, I want to support a more dynamic UI that lets me edit / update all the existing podcasts, and to see what was published and when. So this won't just be the Podcast inception as was done in the JavaFX `desktop` project.

Fourth, it'd be nice to use Vue.js for this. I found that it provides a nice experience for building data-driven, form-driven user interfaces. But, then again, I haven't done anything particularly complicated with it so who knows?

Fifth, I've got a mock-api that i'm using to mock out the actual podcast publication API. I might check that into this repository for a while as well. The goal is to prototype out a few scenarios:

* uploading a new podcast with the complete data required.
* uploading a new file

Sixth, will I need a custom domain or could I deploy this as an Electron.js application? It'd be easier, basically, to use https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/first-app#trying-this-example[Electron.js].

Once the mock design is working, it'll be time to integrate it with the API.

.Here's the old JavaFX design for reference

== Maintaining the Application

![CI](https://github.com/bootiful-podcast/desktop-v2/workflows/CI/badge.svg)


This project supports editing podcasts. It's [based on Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and integrates with the Spring Boot-based backend in [`api-v2`](https://github.com/bootiful-podcast/api-v2).

== Project setup

```
npm install
```

=== Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

=== Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

=== Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

=== Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

=== Environment-Specific Configuration

There are two `.env.\*` properties each containing environment-specific environment varaibles that get interpolated into the build thanks to Webpack. If you run `npm run build`, it'll pull in the variables defined in `.env.production`, and otherwise it'll pull in the environment variables from `.env`.

=== Previewing the Production Application

It's important that you serve the static JavaScript assets as an HTTP service. You can't just open it in your local browser relative to the filesystem.

Build the application as usual (`npm run build`) and then serve it using any of a number of convenient utilities that serve static assets.

I have a little Python script that serves the data from the application:

```
#!/bin/bash
p=${1:-8020}
d=${2:-$PWD}
echo $d
cd $d
python -m SimpleHTTPServer $p
```

Put that in a `.sh` script, remember to `chmod a+x` the script, and then run it like this:

```
./script.sh 8020 .
```

I assume, in that incantation, that `.` points to the root of the application or the `dist` directory in which you've built the production assets.


=== Favicon.ico

I used [this website](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/) to take an [image](https://github.com/the-trump-dump/site-generator/blob/master/src/main/resources/static/Donald-GOP.png) and turn it into
the `favicon.ico` for the site.
